== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why aren't my height and width attributes working? =

Perhaps you are not aware, but the attributes "height" and "width" are case sensitive. Please remember to use all lowercase letters when adding attributes.

= Are there any other available attributes? =

The Current Available Attributes are:

-height (sets height of video)
-width (sets width of video)
-class (adds a custom css class to your video)
-portrait (when false(default), removes the image from the top left of video)
-byline (when false(default), removes "From #####"  in the title
-autoplay (when true, plays the video automatically) (default: false)

= Why does my video look disproportioned? =

When setting height and width attributes, they should maintain the same aspect ration of the original video..

i.e. height="250" width="400", or 1 : 1.6

= How do I enable AutoPlay? =

Autoplay was added in version 2.5. Make sure your current plugin version is > or = 2.5.  IF it is, simply add the attribute "autoplay=true" to the shortcode.

i.e. [ylwm_vimeo autoplay="true"]1234567[/ylwm_vimeo]
