== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why aren't my height and width attributes working? =

Perhaps you are not aware, but the attributes "height" and "width" are case sensitive. Please remember to use all lowercase letters when adding attributes.

= Are there any other available attributes? =

I am constantly updating my plugins. Looks for more attributes very soon!

= Why does my video look disproportioned? =

When setting height and width attributes, they should maintain the same aspect ration of the original video..

i.e. height="250" width="400", or 1 : 1.6
